# Welcome at the IIHE

The Inter-University Institute For High Energies (IIHE) institute is a joined institute of the VUB and ULB high-energy physics groups. To learn more about the institute, you can visit the website: https://iihe.ac.be/. 
The IT group of the IIHE should send you a welcome email regarding the IT infrastructure. If they have not sent it yet after you arrive at the institute, you can ask them via support-iihe@listserv.vub.ac.be. This welcome email should give pointers to IIHE indico account registration, access to the computing cluster (the so-called "m-machines"), etc. 

Additional useful links and information:
- IIHE indico, for meeting agendas: https://indico.iihe.ac.be/. Note that you need to create a different account than you use for cern indico (https://indico.cern.ch/category/6803/). Once you have created your IIHE indico account, you should ask Gerrit to be added to the CMS IIHE indico group to get access to CMS-internal meetings.


# Welcome in CERN and CMS

In order to join the CMS experiment, here are a few pointers.
- CERN and CMS registration: see https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/cms-registration-and-computing-account# and https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookGetAccount
- Mattermost: https://mattermost.web.cern.ch. This is a chat platform that we use for quick direct communication with the group members. Once you have a CERN account, you can set up Mattermost and ask someone group members 
- The CMS Data Analysis School (CMS DAS) is highly recommended at the start of the PhD. This school is held every year in Fermilab in January and in Europe in the middle of the year. See https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/CMSschoolsCommittee for a list of upcoming and past CMS DAS schools.
- CMS DAS school introduction talks, e.g. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/overview. In particular:
  - Intro talk on CMS detector: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/timetable/#3-plenary-talk-cms-detector
  - Intro talk on CMS research program: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/timetable/#4-plenary-talk-cms-physics-pro
- CADI, a database of ongoing as well as published CMS analyses, with links to their papers and CMS-internal Analysis Notes: https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines
- iCMS, a platform for various CMS-internal management tasks and documents: https://icms.cern.ch/tools/. For instance, here you can also search specific CMS-internal analysis notes: https://icms.cern.ch/tools/publications/notes/entries/AN/.

# Welcome tot the VUB H+jet analysis group

## Meetings Useful CMS meetings to attend (semi-)regularly:
- Weekly VUB H+c & friends meeting on Monday afternoon, see https://indico.iihe.ac.be/category/1/search?q=H%2Bc. Topics discussed here are H+jet analysis efforts; top quark pair associated charm quark pair production (tt+cc); heavy jet flavor identification developments.
- CMS HIG PAG meetings: https://indico.cern.ch/category/26/. The general HIG PAG meeting can be useful, typically on Tuesdays at 14:00 (biweekly, sometimes also off-week), and especially the HZZ (= H decaying to ZZ) subgroup meeting, typically on Friday at 14:00 (weekly or biweekly).
- CMS POG or other meetings on objects that are relevant to your research (b tagging, jets, generators...)

## Documentation
- CMS paper of the measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section in the H->ZZ->4lepton final state, that has similarities to our H+jet analysis: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04956
- Higgs/charm workshop May 2024: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/ 
  In particular, see talks of Felix on the analysis: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/contributions/5900707/
- Nordin on simulation in the SM and EFT: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/contributions/5857938/  https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/
