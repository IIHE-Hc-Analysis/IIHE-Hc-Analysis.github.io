# **The IIHE**

The Inter-University Institute For High Energies (IIHE) institute is a joined institute of the VUB and ULB high-energy physics groups. To learn more about the institute, you can visit the [IIHE website](https://iihe.ac.be/). 
The IT group of the IIHE should send you a welcome email regarding the IT infrastructure. If they have not sent it yet after you arrive at the institute, you can ask them via support-iiheATlistserv.vub.ac.be. Their welcome email should give pointers to IIHE indico account registration, access to the [T2B computing cluster](https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/First_access_to_t2b) (including the so-called "m-machines"), etc. 

Additional useful links and information:
- [IIHE indico](https://indico.iihe.ac.be/), for meeting agendas. Note that you need to create a different account than you use for [cern indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/6803/). Once you have created your IIHE indico account, you should ask Gerrit to be added to the CMS IIHE indico group to get access to CMS-internal meetings.


# **CERN and the CMS experiment**

Here are a few pointers that are useful for newcomers in CERN and the CMS experiment.

## CERN and CMS registration
- see the page on the website of the [CMS secretariat](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/cms-registration-and-computing-account#) and the [CMS twiki]([https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookGetAccount). With you CERN account, you can get access to CMS-internal websites (e.g. [twikis](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS)) and the lxplus computing cluster. 

## Communication
- [CERN Mattermost](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch), a chat platform that we use for quick direct communication with the group members. Once you have a CERN account, you can set up Mattermost and ask one of the group members (e.g. Gerrit) to be added to the CMS experiment team and the relevant discussion channels.
- [CMS-talk](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/), a forum of the CMS Collaboration for physics and technical discussions, meeting announcements, etc, on a wide range of topics. Suggested categories to "unmute" depend on your analysis, but may include categories of topics such as Higgs physics, jets, b-tagging, leptons, statistical tools, etc. It is useful to enable the email mode, and create filters based on subject via your email client to sort the (potentially hundreds of) messages per day. There is also a separate instance of this forum, [CMS-pubtalk](https://cms-pub-talk.web.cern.ch/), for discussions on specific analysis reviews and publications.

## Schools and introductions
- The CMS Data Analysis School (CMSDAS) is highly recommended at the start of a PhD. This school is held two times a year: in Fermilab in January and in Europe in the middle of the year. See this [list of upcoming and past CMSDAS schools](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/CMSschoolsCommittee).
- CMSDAS school introduction talks, e.g. [see the timetable of a 2024 CMS DAS school](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/overview). In particular:
  - [Intro talk on CMS detector](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/timetable/#3-plenary-talk-cms-detector)
  - [Intro talk on CMS research program](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1388937/timetable/#4-plenary-talk-cms-physics-pro)

## Other relevant CMS platforms and tools
- [CADI](https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines), a database of ongoing as well as published CMS analyses, with links to their papers and CMS-internal Analysis Notes
- [iCMS](https://icms.cern.ch/tools/), a platform for various CMS-internal management tasks and documents. For instance, here you can also search specific CMS-internal [analysis notes](https://icms.cern.ch/tools/publications/notes/entries/AN/). This is also the platform where information on Experimental Physics Responsbilities (EPR) is managed.
- Obtain a [grid certificate](https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/Getting_a_certificate_for_the_T2) and install it as instructed in your browser and on the m-machines. This will enable you to use the grid, and get access to certain CMS-internal tools such as the [CMS data aggregation service](https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/).  

# **The VUB H+jet analysis group**

## Meetings and collaborations
VUB specific meetings:
- [Weekly VUB H+c & friends meeting](https://indico.iihe.ac.be/category/1/search?q=H%2Bc) on Monday at 13:00. Topics discussed here are H+jet analysis efforts; top quark pair associated charm quark pair production (tt+cc); and heavy jet flavor identification developments.
- [Biweekly joined meetings of the VUB, Athens, Brown University groups](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7320/search?q=H%2Bc+with+H-%3EZZ) on Tuesday at 14:00. These groups are also involved in H+c with H->ZZ (and related work), and these collaborations are relevant towards CMS publication.

Useful CMS meetings to attend (semi-)regularly:
- [CMS HIG PAG meetings](https://indico.cern.ch/category/26/). The general HIG PAG meeting can be useful, typically on Tuesday at 14:00 (biweekly, sometimes also off-week), and **especially** the HZZ (= H decaying to ZZ) subgroup meeting, typically on Friday at 14:00 (weekly or biweekly).
- [CMS POG or other meetings](https://indico.cern.ch/category/6803/) on objects or tools that are relevant to your research ([b tagging](https://indico.cern.ch/category/1309/), [jets](https://indico.cern.ch/category/1308/), [Monte Carlo generators](https://indico.cern.ch/category/548/), ...).
- [CMS general weekly meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/677/), typically on Thursday at 16:00.

The H+c analysis is part of a broader inter-university iBOF project in Belgium focusing on the charm-Higgs Yukawa coupling measurement. We meet with the other researchers a few times a year. You can try to add yourself to the [CERN e-group](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSearch.do) "be-charm-Higgs" (only applicable for PhD students and postdocs). Ask Gerrit if you experience problems. 

## Documentation
- CMS paper [HIG-19-001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04956) of the measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section in the H->ZZ->4lepton final state, that has similarities to our H+jet analysis.
- [Higgs/charm workshop May 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/). In particular, see [talk of Felix on the H+c analysis](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/contributions/5900707/)
  and [talk of Nordin on simulation in the SM and EFT](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1347445/contributions/5857938/)

## Analysis code framework
- We have an [organization on github](https://github.com/IIHE-Hc-Analysis), with analysis repositories (README not yet available, <mark>to do</mark>). To get access to the code repositories, communicate to one of the group members (e.g. Gerrit) the username or email address you use for github.
